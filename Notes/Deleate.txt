after that i have create a todo controller which will capture the id with the help of Request RequestParams


  Predicate<? super Todo>predicate = todo -> todo.getId() ==id ;

  Predicate<? super Todo>: This part is declaring the type of the variable predicate. It's a Predicate that operates on objects of type Todo. The ? super Todo is a wildcard that allows you to use the Predicate on any superclass of Todo as well.
