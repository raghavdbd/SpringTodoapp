@RequestParams is to capture form Details


Command Bean or Form Backing Object

currently what er are doing we are using@ Requestparams to caputure form data but this cause lot 
of issue as we have to write a lot of code so to avoid that problem what we can do we 
use a command beam or form backing Object in this we bind the form with java class
using form tag library

Bindingresult result if result have soe error than not 
@valid annotation is used to validate the bean before the binding occur
